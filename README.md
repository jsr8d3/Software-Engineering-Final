## Description:
In this program, you get to play checkers! You can choose from a set of predetermined users to play as, and you can play against either another user or an AI created by us and test your might. Ideally, this program would also track player stats such as wins, losses, and number of turns per game in a database, and display a leaderboard based on wins in the fewest turns. However, there was an issue with database creation through AWS where the database can only be accessed from the machine that originally created the database. As a result, we have dropped this functionality of our program, but you are still able to play a fun game of checkers!

## How to Launch and Play
Once you have downloaded and extracted the zip file, open it and go to dist/Software Engineering Final Project.exe and click that to run. Once the program has launched, simply select the players you wish to duke it out, and hit the "play" button. This will open up the board. To move a piece, left click the piece you wish to move, then left click the spot you wish to move it to. Pieces are allowed to jump over multiple pieces at a time, and the end spot will be the final spot you wish the piece to move to. A game ends when one player has zero remaining possible moves. Once the game ends, you will be taken back to the start screen and can play again with new people/computers if you wish.
